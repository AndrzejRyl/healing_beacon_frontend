# healing_beacon_frontend

During Beacon Valley Hackathon, in 24h we were able to create powerful app for doctors in hospitals. Thanks to kontakt.io beacons and a REST API based on Rails we managed to implement AndroidApp which helps doctors take better care of their patients. We provide various medical researches and charts. We can also check prescribed drugs or patients history. Security is provided thanks to a private hospital database and application which is not distributed on Google Play. Tablets and phones with app would only be distributed to selected personnel.

This is a live repository we used during hackaton.
